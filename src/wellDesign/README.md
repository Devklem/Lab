# Well Design & Architecture

A repository for a set of codes to vizualize a wellbore with pertinent information. 

The codes allow users to add various well construction elements (such as casings and cements) with simple object definitions and calls. Thus, a well is simply a collection of element objects. More well construction elements to come (depends if I have free time or not  ðŸ˜…). 

Current result looks like something below (the dimensions are totally made up lol). See `execute.py` for example on how to create various well elements.

Possible development in the future will most likely revolve around adding more well construction elements such as hanging liners, expandable tubulars, perforation zone, etc. 

Do consider helping!! Always open for a pull request.
